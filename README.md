# Getting Started with the pokemon app

## Something to improve

In the light of getting this project done within a couple of hours, I've done a basic and good enough POC, however, I believe I could improve some of the following stuff if I had more time.

1. can add integration e2e test
2. can introduce a Mui theme provider so that I can have more control of the theme rather than hard-coding the HEX color in code
3. can have a better and thorough UX design about the flow
4. although I've introduced some of the eslint rules to the project, it'd be nice to have prettier configured so that the code style could look more consistent.
5. the UI can be improved as well
6. should take care of the accessibility issue by adding alt, and aria-label, etc.
